The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive financial dashboard, progressively adding features. Initially, a one-page site displaying top currencies, cryptos, and precious metals with historical charts and AI predictions was delivered. Challenges included API rate limiting (CoinGecko), various backend errors (, , MongoDB serialization), and frontend compilation issues, which were systematically debugged and fixed.

The project then evolved to introduce Betty Crystal, an AI trading bot character. This involved developing backend prediction logic, accuracy tracking, and a tiered content strategy (free market outlook, premium gated predictions). User feedback led to significant UI/UX refinements, including multiple iterations on Betty's character design, a shift from Google OAuth to a custom login/signup, and a complete overhaul of the color scheme from blue-heavy to warm emerald/gold tones for a more inviting feel. The most recent focus is on implementing full sign-up, displaying Betty's historical performance, and refining the presentation with accurate dating for predictions.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a one-page website displaying top currency, cryptocurrency (7), and precious metal prices. A key feature was a graphical 1-week history for each asset, coupled with AI-driven predictions for 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year, with dynamic scaling. The UI should be a modern, sleek trader interface.

Subsequently, a new feature, Betty Crystal, an AI trading bot, was requested. Betty's functionality includes:
1.  A nice icon/graphic (evolved into a character design).
2.  Making 3 predictions each week (for major commodities/currencies), specifying direction (up/down) and magnitude, presented weekly on Monday.
3.  Tracking and displaying her accuracy score, with a starting record based on 2 weeks of past predictions (3/3 and 2/3 correct).
4.  Gating her weekly top picks behind a sign-up/login (later a paywall), while general market trends and graphs remain free.
5.  Using the AI system to refine predictions over time.
6.  The backend should include a simple account creation and login system.
7.  The frontend should display Betty's historical picks, her cumulative accuracy, and proper dating for all predictions. The design was refined to use warmer colors.

        -   Initial setup for , , , , .
        -   Integration of  and  for data fetching and LLM predictions, with fallback logic for rate-limiting.
        -   Refined error handling and  usage.
        -   Introduction of Betty Crystal endpoints: , .
        -   MongoDB models for , , .
        -   Authentication logic: initially Google OAuth, then custom  and  routes, session handling.
        -   Fixes for MongoDB  and datetime serialization.
        -   Initialization of Betty's historical performance data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on enhancing Betty Crystal's functionality and user experience. This involved:

1.  **Addressing Crypto Data and Graphs:** Investigating why cryptocurrency data and graphs were not displaying, despite the backend API () returning data correctly (as confirmed in Message 341). The focus shifted to frontend loading issues.
2.  **Implementing Account Creation:** Adding sign-up functionality to the application to allow new users to register. This involved updating both backend API endpoints () and frontend state/UI () to handle new user registrations.
3.  **Betty's Historical Tracking System:** Developing a system to store and display Betty's past predictions and their accuracy. This includes:
    *   Creating Pydantic models () and MongoDB collection () on the backend () to log weekly prediction results.
    *   Initializing Betty with two weeks of mock historical data (3/3 and 2/3 accuracy) to provide a starting cumulative accuracy score (5/6 correct, 83.3%).
    *   Updating frontend () to fetch and display this real historical accuracy in Betty's accuracy bubble.
4.  **Displaying Historical Picks and Messaging:** Preparing the frontend to display Betty's historical picks and update the front-page messaging to clearly show Bettys historical picks and accuracy" and "Bettys future top three picks for the upcoming week, including proper dating for predictions (start and end dates).
5.  **Access Control ( vs  accounts):** Planning to implement different access levels for a demo version (allowing users to see the sign-in area without picks) and a master version for the owner.

The last action was to add a historical data display component and different access levels to the content area of the frontend (Message 395).
