## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

### Issue: "Betty still shows 73% accuracy"
**Solution:** Backend startup initialization not running
```bash
# Check backend logs for "Betty's historical data initialized on startup" 
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend*.log
```

### Issue: "No Analyze buttons visible" 
**Solution:** Frontend not updated or CSS issue
```bash
# Verify analyze button is in App.js
grep -n "Analyze" /app/frontend/src/App.js
# Should return line ~437 with analyze button code
```

### Issue: "Market data not loading"
**Solution:** Backend URL incorrect or CoinGecko rate limiting
```bash
# Test crypto endpoint directly
curl GET {backend_url}/api/crypto
# Should return 8 cryptocurrencies with fallback data
```

### Issue: "Premium features not working"
**Solution:** Premium endpoints not accessible  
```bash
# Test premium endpoint (should return 403 without auth)
curl GET {backend_url}/api/betty/premium-insights
```

## üìû SUPPORT

If you encounter issues during upload:

1. **Run the test script first:** `python test_deployment.py`
2. **Check specific failing tests** and fix those components
3. **Verify file uploads completed** for all critical files
4. **Clear browser cache** and test in incognito mode
5. **Check server logs** for any startup errors

**The preview environment shows everything working correctly, so any upload issues are likely due to file sync or environment configuration differences.**
